Solving simple to complex problems, with time and space efficiency using OOP and appropriate data structures

**This repository contains common use case problems and their solution in python. Each problem has a unique python file associated with it and labeled accordingly.** 

- *Linked List Sum Problem*: Given two linked lists of numbers, with digits stored in reverse order, add the two numbers in the real order and return the solution as a linked list in reverse order 
- *Longest Substring without repeating characters*: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
- *The two sum problem*: Given an array of integers, returning indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specified target
- *Reverse Integer*: Given a 32- bit signed integer generate the reverse of the given integer
- *Roman number to Integer*: Given a string containing a sequence of Roman numbers convert it to an integer
- *Longest Common Prefix*: Given an array of strings pick out a common substring(which is also prefix) amongst the elements of the array 
- *Valid Parantheses*: Given a string of brackets determine if the sequence is properly closed i.e. if the string is valid 
- *Removing Duplicates from a Sorted Array*: Given an array of sorted numbers remove the dupicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.
